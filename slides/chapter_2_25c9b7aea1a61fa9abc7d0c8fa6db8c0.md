Python is also able to do maths super fast and is user friendly!

You can type in mathematical expressions and it will calculate the answer for you. 

Here's an example:
```
>>> print(7 + 7 - 1)
>>> 13
```

## Order of Operations

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b26851c2c5"
```

`@part1`
In the previous slide, we discussed that the `*` and `\` symbols denote multiplication and division respectively. 

Python also calculates using the standard order of operations such as BODMAS.

1. Brackets - `()`
2. Order (Exponents, Powers, Roots) - `**`
3. Multiplication or Division - `*` or `/`
4. Addition or Subtraction - `+` or `-`

Make sure you close your brackets off properly!
