## Why Python?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "6779624f0d"
```

`@part1`
We will be teaching you programming skills using a computer language called `Python`.

Some applications of Python include: creating and managing websites, writing scripts to automate mundane tasks, parsing and analysing big data, and machine learning algorithms.

The concepts we teach will exist in other languages and your skills you learn from us will be transferable to other languages.

## How this works

`@part1`
Our method of teaching Python means you don't need to install Python onto your PC, and is accessible by any device online.

If you would like to install the Python software on your PC, click on this link if you are a [Windows user](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2-amd64.exe) and this if you a [MacOS user](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2-macosx10.9.pkg). Although Python comes with an IDLE, we highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) as your Code Editor to program in Python.
